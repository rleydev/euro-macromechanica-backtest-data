# euro macromechanica — backtest data hub (⚠️ third‑party datasets inside)

This repository stores raw market datasets (e.g., HistData), prepared files, compiled calendars,
and analysis aggregates used for **transparency and reproducibility** of the EMM backtest.

> **Legal:** rights in third‑party datasets remain with their providers. This repo does **not** re‑license them.
> See `LICENSES.md`, `NOTICE-THIRD-PARTY.*`, and `SOURCES.md`.
